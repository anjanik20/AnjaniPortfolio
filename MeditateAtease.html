                    The journey of designing meditation app started off by understanding the needs and preferences of users. To begin with, in person interviews were conducted as well as google form was distributed. Through this process users’ interest in meditation practices, their experiences with stress, anxiety, sadness was recognized and their familiarity with existing meditation apps was explored. This research provided valuable insights into the features the users desired, challenges they faced as well as their overall perception towards digital solutions for mindfulness was known. Their pain points, frustrations, dislikes were acknowledged. Building upon these insights, user personas were created which included user goals, motivation, preferences and challenges. The personas acted as a foundational guide throughout the design process, ensuring that the meditation app was effective and designed in a such manner which would offer a seamless experience that aligns with users’ needs and enhances their meditation practice.

                            The Meditate At Ease--Meditation app offers a holistic experience for users searching for mindfulness and relaxation. Designed an engaging platform where users can learn different meditation techniques, regardless of their proficiency level. Accessibility and inclusivity were a fundamental priority during designing the meditation application. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing Meditate at Ease from empathising with the users to designing user-centric solution. The feedback given by the users throughout the process were invaluable really helped in creating a user-friendly application. I’m really excited about the idea of incorporating AR/VR into the application. I look forward. I look forward to keep making improvements to the designs , add new features and enhance overall experience.

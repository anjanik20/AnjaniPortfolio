                    The design of ShieldHer(Self-defense app) began by gaining a clear understanding of safety concerns and challenges faced by woman. To gather insights both google form survey was distributed and in person interviews were conducted This research allowed to get a deeper understanding of women’s perception of personal safety, their familiarity with self defense techniques and the challenges they face. Additionally, users comfort with digital tools and whether they have used any self-defense apps or resources was known. The research helped uncover users’ paint points and frustrations. Users’ motivations and needs were recognized. Moreover, users shared what features they would like to see and what things were missing. Building on this research, user personas were created highlighting users goals, motivation, challenges and preferences. The personas played a really crucial role in guiding the design process, making sure that the end result would be a user-centred solution that effectively addresses the needs of all users.

Each time when on completing a self-defense technique within a specific category, users will earn a star. Upon collecting two stars users will earn a badge. The more the badges earned within the specific category the more the progress and techniques learned will be reflected. This system aims to encourage users, boost their confidence and motivate them as they master each technique step by step.

                        <h5>An idea for incorporating AR into ShieldHer--Self Defense Mobile-Application for Women.</h5>
                        <p class="arvr-description">
                            Augmented Reality(AR) can be used to provide real-time feedback to check whether user’s posture while practicing specific self-defense techniques is correct or incorrect. A feedback button can be added to the mobile-application for each self-defense technique. Upon pressing the feedback button the application will ask for the permission of the user to access the camera. Once permission granted, an overlay will be activated to assess users posture. Green color will indicate the posture of the user is correct while the red color will provide areas where the posture is incorrect. Additionally, voice feedback can be incorporated through which verbal comments can be given to inform the users where they are going wrong.

                            ShieldHer- Self-defense application for woman provides a platform for women who are seeking empowerment and safety. Designed an application where multiple self-defense techniques offered to woman which also includes self-defense techniques for senior and those with disabilities. Making sure that everyone can benefit. The application features an emergency call button and an SOS button which is present on the start screen as well as in the navigation bar. The self-defense techniques are also labelled for beginners, Intermediate and advanced so that women can choose according to their skill set. Personal goals can be written down by users and reminders can be set accordingly. To enhance motivation an achievement system is introduced in the application. Accessibility was a crucial component throughout the design process. I thoroughly enjoyed designing this application from research phase to high fidelity design. The feedback received throughout the design process was really valuable for creating a user friendly solution. I am eager and excited to keep improving the application based on new ideas and user-insights which includes expanding the range of self-defense techniques for women with disabilities. Making sure that the content provided is relevant to all users. I am really enthusiastic to incorporate the idea AR into the application in the future.

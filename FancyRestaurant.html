                    In this project, a goal directed approach has been taken into consideration to align the design with user needs and expectations. The process began with user research where multiple users were interviewed about their experiences with restaurant apps, revealing the challenges they faced and the features they needed. Additionally we explored users comfort with digital products particularly for tasks like reservations, payments, and browsing menus. By empathizing with their frustrations and understanding their needs, we were able to craft solutions that addressed their problems. Hypothetical personas were then created based on the gathered data, representing various user types and guiding the design process. This approach ensured that the final product was both functional and user-centered, meeting the expectations of the audience.

Moreover, explored whether the users are comfortable with using digital products particularly for tasks like reservations, payments and browsing menus.

                            The web-app designed and developed for the fancy restaurant “The Majestic Table” provided valuable insights into crafting a solution which would meet the needs of users. The goal was to create a web-app which would provide easy and efficient payment processes as well as detailed menu descriptions. Additionally, create an intuitive and seamless app experience for the users. It was a great experience in designing such a web-app. I personally learnt to empathize with the users during the process. The insights and feedback provided by the users based on the low-fidelity prototypes really helped me build a user-centered solution. While developing the web-app I understood the importance of accessibility and how it can be incorporated throughout the designs due to which the app would be accessible to huge range of users. I am eager to design and develop more solutions while expanding and applying my knowledge.
